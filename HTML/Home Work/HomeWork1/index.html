            <b>The Simpsons</b> (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. 
            The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. 
            The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society, politics, and history.
            The cartoon made its debut as 60-second animated bumpers for The Tracey Ullman Show, with the first short airing on April 19, 1987. 
            The shorts were then expanded into a full-length 30-minute television spin-off by 20th Century Fox, first airing on December 17, 1989. 
            As of 2021, 33 seasons have aired, with the 34th airing since September 25.
            The series currently holds the record for the longest-running prime-time sitcom in the US, running for 32 years and 34 seasons, as well as three seasons of shorts since 1989, and becoming the longest-running program on FOX.

            <b>Homer Jay Simpson</b> (born May 12, 1956 or 1969 or 1977 or 1983)is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie. Homer Simpson is 39 years old.
            His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse".
            Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.[41]
            Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.
            Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day of the Locust, a 1939 novel by Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive.

            <b>Lisa Marie Simpson</b> (born May 9) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
            In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. 
            She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. 
            Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. 
            In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. 
            In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. 
            She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. 
            Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who she deems lower than her or even above her. 
            She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. 
            Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
